## High Performance Computing

Using AWS to design a pipeline for gathering surveys from users for beta testing of an app, evaluating and eliminating non-valid entries (short time or no comment).

we use SQS and SNS for sending surveys, 

Lambdas for filtering the responses

DynamoDB for storing the valid queries for later analysis inside a table


this is a series of tasks and I am only putting one section for demonstration. 
other parts are as below:
