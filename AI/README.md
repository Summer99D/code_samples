in This folder you will find LLM finetuning and prompt engineering codes. the prompt engineering project is part of a bigger project for "Machine Learning in Finance" course where we train ChatGPT using WSJ news headlines so that they can act as a "financial analyst" with three different personas. 

Bull: optimistic  toward market volatility

Bear: Pessimistic toward market volatility

Neutral relatively objective. 


in previous parts of the project we had generated pre-labled new topics and the regression between market return and these topics and after training the AI model we compared the R-squared of each of them to conclude that pre-labled new topics have better predictive power for market return.
