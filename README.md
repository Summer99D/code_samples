3. Prompt engineering in AI folder: using WSJ news topics for generating prompts with different personas

no file is a full project and therefore is not producable. I have removed loading packages and datasets. each subfolder however, has a readME file that redirects you to the original complete project in case you wanted to see the whole process.
